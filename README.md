# MilestoneProject1

Requirements:
This project is totally based in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and should run in the browser with minimal issues.  


Introduction:
This project is a game based on the popular gameshow Jeopardy.  I have always enjoyed the show and trivia in general, so I thought it would be fun to make a little project based on that.  

How to Play:
The game starts as soon as the page loads and you are able to click different value buttons to reveal clues.  Once a clue is clicked, use the keyboard to input your answer and the enter key to submit.  

Bugs/Known Issues:
Currently, the only major issue the game has is that once a clue has been click, the mouse is unable to be used to click in the form or to click the submit button.  If this occurs, press tab, then enter to open a new clue from inside the open clue and it should display a new clue with the cursor flashing in the form box.
